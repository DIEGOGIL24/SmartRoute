    REQUIRED ACTIONS:
    1. Call get_weather(city="{destination}") to get current conditions
    2. Call get_forecast_weather(place="{destination}", days={time_range}) to get forecast
    3. ANALYZE the API data and ADD a "summary" field to EACH forecast item with your recommendation

    CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS FOR SUMMARIES:
    - For EACH item in the forecasts array, ADD a new field called "summary"
    - The summary must be ONE sentence with a practical recommendation
    - Base your summary on the specific weather data of that forecast (temperature, rain, wind, etc.)
    - Examples: 
      * "Ideal day for outdoor activities with pleasant temperatures and clear skies."
      * "Bring an umbrella as rain is expected throughout the day."
      * "Strong winds expected, not recommended for outdoor events."

    IMPORTANT: 
    - You MUST use both tools to get real API data
    - Do NOT invent weather numbers (temp, humidity, etc.)
    - DO add your expert summary/recommendation to each forecast
    - The dates in the forecast come from OpenWeatherMap API""",
